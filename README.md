# What you need?

If I am not missing stuff (please make a pull request if something is missing that must be added):

| Package | Which functions? |
| --- | --- |
| xgboost (0.60) | xgb.ncv
| outliers | rule_single, rule_double |
| R.utils | rule_single, rule_double |
| data.table | read_sparse_csv |
| Matrix | read_sparse_csv |
| recommenderlab | read_sparse_csv (only when using NAs as sparse) |
| Rtsne | tsne_grid |
| tabplot | tableplot_jpg |
| caret | xgb.ncv |


# What is inside?

| Function Name | Type | What is it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tsne_grid | Dimensionality Reduction + Grid Search | Allows to grid search a seed and a perplexity interval using t-SNE, while returning the best t-SNE model along with the best iteration found, all in a fully verbose fashion. |
| read_sparse_csv | Iterated numeric sparse matrix reading | R always imports CSV as dense. This function allows to read very large CSVs in chunks by variables (or a specific subset of variables), outputting a sparse matrix with typically lower RAM usage than a dense matrix if sparsity is high enough, all in a fully verbose fashion. Sparsity can be defined as 0 or NA, while saving as RDS is available in the loading streak. |
| tableplot_jpg | Batch tableplot output to JPEG | Allows to create a tableplot which is immediately turned into JPEG in batch per variable, against a label. It allows to preview features in a more understandable fashion than eyeballing numeric values. |
| xgb.ncv | Repeated xgboost Cross-Validation | Allows to run a repeated xgboost cross-validation with fully verbosity of aggregate summaries, computation time, and ETA of computation, with fixed seed and a sink to store xgboost verbose data, and also out-of-fold predictions and external data prediction. |
| rule_single | Outlying Univariate Continuous Association Rule Finder | Allows to use an outlying univariate continuous association rule finder on data and predicts immediately. Intermediate outlying scores can be stored. High verbosity of outputs during computation.
| rule_double | Outlying Bivariate Linear Continuous Association Rule Finder | Allows to use an outlying bivariate linear continuous association rule finder on data and predicts immediately. Intermediate outlying scores cannot be stored. If a bivariate combination is ill-conditioned (sum of correlation matrix = 4), that bivariate combination is skipped to avoid a solver matrix inversion crash/freeze/interruption when trying to compute Mahalanobis distance dimensionality reduction. High verbosity of outputs during computation. Potential TO-DO: give the user the possibility to use their own dimensionality reduction function (like a truncated PCA 1-axis).

To add:

* xgboost grid search
* xgboost unbalanced large dataset learning
* large sparse matrix loader for categorical data
* Categorical to Numeric converter: h2o's autoencoder, mxnet's autoencoder, t-SNE, Generalized Low Rank Models, largeVis, FeatureHashing - along with testing performance using xgboost
* Logloss brute force calibration
* Prediction Analyzer (analyze any type of model predictions, currently only binary)
* Automated Feature Creator (create automatically features using linear (^1), quadratic (^2), cubic (^3), quartic (^4), mean, and standard deviation of different random features as inputs) - all with a GUI to interrupt without losing data with full verbosity of search
* Automated Feature Analyzer (analyze created features and test against randomness of improval) - all with verbosity
* Leave-one-out encoding (encodes any categorical using a continuous variable such as the label or a feature)
* AND MANY MORE...
