\usage{
LauraeML_gblinear(x, y, data, label, folds)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Type: vector (numeric). The hyperparameters to use.}

\item{y}{Type: vector (numeric). The features to use, as binary format (0 for not using, 1 for using).}

\item{data}{Type: data.table (mandatory). The data features. Comes from \code{LauraeML}.}

\item{label}{Type: vector (numeric). The labels. Comes from \code{LauraeML}.}

\item{folds}{Type: list of numerics. The folds as list. Comes from \code{LauraeML}.}
}
\value{
The score of the cross-validated xgboost gblinear model, for the provided hyperparameters and features to use.
}
\description{
This function is a demonstration function for using xgboost gblinear in \code{LauraeML} without premade folds. It has \code{alpha}, \code{lambda}, and \code{lambda_bias} as tunable hyperparameters. It also accepts feature selection, and performs full logging (every part is commented in the source) with writing to an external file in order to follow the hyperparameters and feature count.
